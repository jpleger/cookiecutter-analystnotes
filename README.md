# cookiecutter-analystnotes
The goal of this is to provide a consistent scaffolding for incident responders or analysts to store/manage their incident notes.

Often times, there are malicious artifacts, rules and other items that are created during an incident and the goal of this is to provide a repeatable template for directories, files and common information so that structured analysis is possible at a later date.
